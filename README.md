# DC Motor Controller for Row Seeder

## Project Description
This project focuses on the design and development of a modular DC motor controller system for a row seeder.
The system ensures precise control over seed dispensing and supports communication with external devices via CAN protocol.

The project consists of a main controller board an an extension board connected via 2.54mm pin sockets:
- **Main Controller Board: Handles motor control, sensor readings and CAN communication protocol.
- **Extension Board: Adds high-current switches and extra digital inputs for expanded functionality.

This modular approach allows future modifications for broader compatibility and functionality.
